# django-nuxtjs-authentication

A tutorial to add authentication to your Nuxtjs project using the
django-rest-framework as backend.

The tutorial is split into two parts: one for the
backend (django-rest-framework) and the other for the frontend (Nuxtjs).
The repository also contains the corresponding branches: `part-1` and
`part-2` to make it easier for you to follow along if you want to.
